# Best Beer List

## Problem:

We would like you to use HTML, CSS and Javascript to read the API and display it in
an organized way. In addition, you should add in a simple sorting mechanic to the
front-end. Feel free to use any frameworks you would like to achieve the task.

## What I Used:

Html, CSS, Javascript, and an API provided.

## How I Made It:

First, I had to add the API into my javascript and get the data. Checking by going into the page's inspect and going to console, I can see that the Array is shown. From There I just had to pick and choose what pieces I wanted displayed by my Html. I know that I had to display the ABV and IBU, anything else was up to me. Lastly, I wanted the page to look nice and organized. So took my time with CSS.
